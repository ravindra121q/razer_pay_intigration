## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Razorpay Account**: You need to sign up for a Razorpay account at [Razorpay Signup](https://razorpay.com/).

- **Web Application**: You should have a web application where you want to integrate Razorpay for payment processing.

- **Server-Side Implementation**: This guide assumes you have a server-side application to handle payment requests.

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repository to get started with the Razorpay integration. Follow the steps below to integrate Razorpay into your application.

## Setting Up Your Razorpay Account

1. [Sign in](https://razorpay.com/) to your Razorpay account.

2. Navigate to the Razorpay Dashboard and obtain your `API Key` and `API Secret` from the `Settings` section. You will need these for the integration.

3. Set up the necessary webhook URLs in your Razorpay dashboard to handle events like payment confirmation and refunds.

## Integration Steps

1. Include the Razorpay JavaScript library in your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/razorpay.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create a Razorpay instance in your JavaScript code:

   ```javascript
   var rzp = new Razorpay({
       key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
   });
   ```

3. Create an order on the server-side, and pass the order ID to the client.

4. Trigger the payment when a user clicks on the payment button:

   ```javascript
   rzp.open({
       amount: 1000, // The amount in paise (100 paise = 1 INR)
       currency: 'INR',
       name: 'Your Company Name',
       description: 'Payment for your product',
       order_id: 'YOUR_ORDER_ID',
       handler: function (response) {
           // Handle the payment success or failure here
       },
   });
   ```

5. Handle the payment response on the server-side to confirm the payment.

6. Set up webhooks to handle various events and keep track of payments and refunds.

## Usage

Provide clear and detailed instructions on how to use the Razorpay integration in your web application. Include code examples, configurations, and any relevant details to help users understand the integration process.
